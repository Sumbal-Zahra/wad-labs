    <h3>What I Did</h3>
    <p>In this lab task, I created a personal website using HTML and CSS. I used semantic HTML tags
        like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and  <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> etc. </p>
    <h3>Why I chose the Tags and Styles</h3>
    <p>
        I chose semantic tags to improve the accessibiity and SEO of the website.
        I also added round corners and interactive elements like hover effects on links and lists.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>

    <p>
        Through this lab task, Ilearned how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML tags and style it 
        using CSS.
        I also gained better understanding of how to use different type of selectors.
